      <p>
        Gameplay: Player will be given a number of contracts to choose from and must divide the available resources for each aspect of the advertisement to perfect it. For example, player have $1000 and 10 employees to make an advertisement for a soda company, each ads requirements consist these categories: target audience, visual quality, viral ability, etc. player would need to consider which category and how much should they spend their resource on it. Completing a contract give more money and fame/reputation. Money will help increase budget and resources for contracts, reputation will help get better, profitable contract.
As player progress through the game, they will encounter shady company that is likely to commit fraud, scam, etc. they would usually offer a lot of money but will decrease reputation. In contrast they might also encounter prodigy start-up that will be very successful if you help them make the ad for a cheaper price or even for free but give more reputation in return.
